# I-O-Expedite
A software approach for improving the file system performance on HPC systems

we propose a software approach to improve I/O and reduce the times communicating with metadata server by storing mass files in formatted virtual file blocks. Moreover, we design and implement a software framework, I/O Expedite that allows users to create virtual file blocks of multiple file system and efficiently and effectively manage directory and Permission. The virtual file block is formatted and mounted by user input single command, which makes it convenient for the user to store a lot of I/O intensive files on the relevant block devices. The software framework also supports multiple file system formatting and mounting modes with specified permissions under offline commands. The normalization stipulates the user's permission for the virtual file block, and by grouping the metadata and storing it in the file block efficiently, it can reduce the number of the metadata server access and effectively group the metadata. Furthermore the software framework is flexible and can be set up in many existing HPC parallel file systems through the POSIX interface, help users store a large number of files in HPC systems. And in order to solve the problem of concurrent I/O writing, we also proposed serveral flexible solutions constructively.
