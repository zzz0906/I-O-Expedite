# I-O-Expedite
A software approach for improving the file system performance on HPC systems

we propose a software approach to improve I/O and reduce the time spent communicating with metadata server by storing mass files in formatted virtual file blocks. Moreover, we design and implement a software framework, I/O Expedite that allows users to create virtual file blocks of multiple file systems and both efficiently and effectively enhance its directory and its directory management. The virtual block is formatted and mounted by a single command, which makes it convenient for users to store a lot of I/O intensive files on appropriate  block devices. The software framework also supports formatting and mounting modes with specified permissions under offline commands of multiple file systems. The normalization stipulates the user's permission for the virtual block, and by grouping metadata and storing it in the file block efficiently. The approach can reduce the number of metadata server accesses and effectively group the metadata. Furthermore, the software framework is flexible and can be set up in many existing HPC parallel file systems through the POSIX interface. It helps users store a large number of files in HPC systems. And in order to solve problems related to concurrent I/O writing, we also proposed several flexible solutions.
